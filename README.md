# Kickstarter-Analysis
Analysis of Kickstarters to uncover trends for Louise
## Overview of Project/Purpose 
The overview of the project for module 1 was to analyze a multitude of different kickstarters for Louise. Louise is looking forward to getting getting started with her own kickstarter for a production but would like to gain some insight into how other similar projects performed.
## Analysis_and_challenges
The analysis of the data shows that based on the data provided - the most successful time to launch a kickstarter is within the month of May. After the month of May - it seems as if though the success rate of kickstarters tend to fall. This is particularly true for those who are looking forward to entering the theatre industry. 
The biggest challenge was technical challenges. When switching from one work sheet to another - the data became nullified. The way around it was unfortunately having to filter the data again & creating another one. 
### Analysis_based_on_Launch_Date
 May is the best month to launch - represented by chart provided
 ### Analysis_of_Outcomes_Based_on_Goals 
 Goals between 10,000 to 15,999 have a significantly higher rate of success
 ### Results
 Two conclusions that can be made for Theatre outcomes based on launch date is that - May is the best month for any theatre kickstarter to begin their funding period. The worst month for theatre kickstarters is December - this is based off of the data provided by the pivot table & line graph which shows an almost 1:1 ratio of successful and failed kickstarters. 
 One conclusion that can be made about the Outcomes based on Goals is that kickstarters that have a goal of 10,000 - 15,999 have significantly higher chances of success in achieving their funding. 
### Limitations
The limitations for this particular data set is that it only has a list of particular countries. This limits the sample size and creates a larger potential margin of error when measuring the stats. As for other graphs that may be useful - perhaps a pie char regarding the success rate of particular subcategories within the parent category would provide a clear picture of what to expect when entering the industry.
